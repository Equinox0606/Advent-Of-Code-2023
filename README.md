# Advent of Code Solutions

## Overview
This repository contains my personal solutions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2023) challenges. Advent of Code is an annual series of fun and engaging programming puzzles designed to cater to a variety of skill levels. They range from simple tasks suitable for beginners to more complex problems for experienced programmers.

## Motivation
The primary goals for undertaking these challenges are:
- **Fun and Enjoyment**: Enjoying the process of solving diverse and creative problems.
- **Sharpen Problem-Solving Skills**: Using these challenges as an opportunity to enhance my problem-solving and coding abilities.
- **Learning and Growth**: Exploring new concepts, algorithms, and programming paradigms.

## Approach
- **Language of Choice**: [Python/JavaScript/Your language] is the primary language used for solving these puzzles.
- **Daily Updates**: I aim to update this repository regularly with new solutions as the event progresses.
- **Clean and Readable Code**: Emphasis on writing clean, efficient, and well-documented code.

## Community and Feedback
- **Collaboration and Discussion**: I welcome any discussions, suggestions, or insights from the community. Feel free to open an issue for discussion or submit a pull request for improvements.
- **Critique and Learning**: I encourage fellow coders and enthusiasts to critique my solutions, offer alternative approaches, or share tips. Such interactions are invaluable for mutual learning and growth.

## Repository Structure
- Each day's challenge is stored in a separate `ipynb` file named `Day_X` where X represents the day number.
- Each filecontains:
  - The problem statement or a link to the same.
  - The solution code.
  - My thought process while solving the problems.

## Usage
Feel free to browse through the solutions, test them out, or use them as a reference for your own Advent of Code journey. If you find any errors or have suggestions for optimization, please let me know.

### Disclaimer
Please note that these solutions are my own attempts at the Advent of Code challenges and reflect my personal approach to problem-solving. They might not always represent the most optimal solutions.
