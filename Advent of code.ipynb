    "Something is wrong with global snow production, and you've been selected to take a look. The Elves have even given you a map; on it, they've used stars to mark the top fifty locations that are likely to be having problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "You've been doing this long enough to know that to restore snow operations, you need to check all fifty stars by December 25th.\n",
    "\n",
    "Collect stars by solving puzzles. Two puzzles will be made available on each day in the Advent calendar; the second puzzle is unlocked when you complete the first. Each puzzle grants one star. Good luck!\n",
    "\n",
    "You try to ask why they can't just use a weather machine (\"not powerful enough\") and where they're even sending you (\"the sky\") and why your map looks mostly blank (\"you sure ask a lot of questions\") and hang on did you just say the sky (\"of course, where do you think snow comes from\") when you realize that the Elves are already loading you into a trebuchet (\"please hold still, we need to strap you in\").\n",
    "\n",
    "As they're making the final adjustments, they discover that their calibration document (your puzzle input) has been amended by a very young Elf who was apparently just excited to show off her art skills. Consequently, the Elves are having trouble reading the values on the document.\n",
    "\n",
    "The newly-improved calibration document consists of lines of text; each line originally contained a specific calibration value that the Elves now need to recover. On each line, the calibration value can be found by combining the first digit and the last digit (in that order) to form a single two-digit number.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "1abc2\n",
    "pqr3stu8vwx\n",
    "a1b2c3d4e5f\n",
    "treb7uchet\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this example, the calibration values of these four lines are 12, 38, 15, and 77. Adding these together produces 142."

    "#### Thought process\n",
    "1. **Class Initialization (`__init__`)**:\n",
    "   - **Core Logic**: The class is initialized with the path to the input file (`input_file`). It also initializes an empty list (`calibration_values`) that will later store the numeric values extracted from each line of the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Reading Input (`read_input`)**:\n",
    "   - **Core Logic**: This method handles reading the file line by line. For each line, it calls the `extract_calibration_value` method to parse and extract a specific numeric value based on the line's content. These values are collected in the `calibration_values` list. After processing all lines, it sums these values by calling `calculate_total_sum`, which represents the total calibration value.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Extracting Calibration Values (`extract_calibration_value`)**:\n",
    "   - **Core Logic**: The method's aim is to process a single line from the input file and extract two specific digits: the first and last digits present in the line. Currently, it iterates through each character and checks if it's a digit. If it finds a digit, it updates the `first_digit` (only if it's the first digit encountered) and `last_digit` (updated for every digit encountered, thus ultimately holding the last digit). The combination of these two digits forms the calibration value for that line. This logic assumes that every character in the line is treated as a separate entity and does not account for multi-digit numbers or spelled-out numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Calculating Total Sum (`calculate_total_sum`)**:\n",
    "   - **Core Logic**: This method simply adds up all the individual calibration values obtained from each line of the input file. It represents the total calibration value across all lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Solving the Puzzle (`solve_puzzle`)**:\n",
    "   - **Core Logic**: This method is the handler of the process. It starts the procedure by calling `read_input` to process the file and extract calibration values from each line. The sum of these values, which is the final answer, is then printed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary of the Thought Process:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The class is designed to process a text file where each line potentially contains numeric information.\n",
    "- The key operation is extracting specific digits (first and last) from each line, assuming each character is a standalone digit.\n",
    "- The overall objective is to sum these extracted values from all lines to get a cumulative calibration value.\n",
    "- The implementation provides a structured approach to reading, processing, and summing data from a text file."

    " 1. **Class Initialization (`__init__`)**:\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Initialize the class with the input file path and prepare for processing.\n",
    "- **Core Logic**: The constructor stores the input file path and initializes an empty list to store calibration values. It also sets up a dictionary (`word_to_number`) to map spelled-out number words to their corresponding digits.\n",

    " 2. **Reading Input (`read_input`)**:\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Read and process each line of the input file.\n",
    "- **Core Logic**: This method reads the file line by line. For each line, it extracts a calibration value using `extract_calibration_value` and accumulates these values in `calibration_values`. Finally, it computes the total sum of these values.\n",
    "\n",
    " 3. **Extracting Calibration Values (`extract_calibration_value`)**:\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Extract the calibration value from a single line of text.\n",
    "- **Core Logic**: This method processes each line to identify both numeric digits and spelled-out numbers. It maintains two dictionaries, `first_occurrence` and `last_occurrence`, to track the first and last appearance of each digit in the line. The method iterates over each character and also checks substrings for spelled-out numbers. It updates the dictionaries based on these findings. Finally, it determines the first and last digits based on the earliest and latest occurrences and combines them into a calibration value.\n",
    "\n",
    " 4. **Calculating Total Sum (`calculate_total_sum`)**:\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Sum all extracted calibration values.\n",
    "- **Core Logic**: Adds up all values stored in `calibration_values` to calculate the total sum, representing the aggregated result of processing all lines in the input file.\n",
    "\n",
    " 5. **Solving the Puzzle (`solve_puzzle`)**:\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Orchestrate the overall process of solving the puzzle.\n",
    "- **Core Logic**: This method is the entry point for the class's functionality. It triggers the reading and processing of the input file and then outputs the final sum of calibration values.\n",

    "- The main operation involves extracting specific digits (first and last) from each line by considering both numeric and spelled-out forms.\n",
    "- The overall objective is to combine these extracted digits into a two-digit number for each line and then sum these numbers to get a cumulative calibration value.\n",
    "- The implementation demonstrates a methodical approach to reading, parsing, and summing data from a text file, accounting for more complex scenarios like multi-digit numbers and spelled-out words."
